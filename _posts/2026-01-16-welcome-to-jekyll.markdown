本篇就是典型的'post'即‘帖子’，帖子以markdown格式进行更新，都放在'_post'文件夹下面，并且在自动构建的过程中，帖子内容会被自动加载。

Jekyll支持Markdown等多种格式文件博客，只需要在文件前填写好头信息，在建立过程中就可以自动转换成HTML格式的文件。

Jekyll很注重博客内容，即博客就是Jekyll框架的核心。

目前关于Jekyll博客内容还有两点不解的内容：模板和插件。

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
